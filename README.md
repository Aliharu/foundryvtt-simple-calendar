A simple calendar module for the FoundryVTT system.

This module allows you to create a calendar with any number of months per year and any number of days per month for your game world.

##GM Features:
* Configure the calendar to meet your worlds needs
    * Set the year as well as add any prefix or postfix to the years name
    * Define how many months in a year
    * Set a custom name for each month
    * Set the number of days in each month
* Set and change the current day as your game story progresses
* Add notes to specific days on the calendar to remind yourself of events or other world related things
    * These notes can either be visible to players as well as the GM or just the GM
    * Allow the players to add their own notes to the calendar
    
##Player Features:
* Browse a calendar interface to see the years, months and day of the game world
