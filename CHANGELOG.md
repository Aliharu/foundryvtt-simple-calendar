## v1.0.0 - Initial Release

The initial public release of the simple calendar.

Set up your game worlds own calendar by configuring:

- The current year and any prefix or postfix on the year.
- The number of months in a year.
- The names of each month.
- The number of days in each month.
- The number  of days in a week and the name of each weekday.

As the GM you will also be able to change the current day in your game and add notes to days. Notes can be events or reminders and can be visible to players or just the GM.

The players are presented with a familiar calendar interface for switching between months and selecting days to see any notes on those days.
